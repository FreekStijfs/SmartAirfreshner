# SmartAirfreshner
During my bachelors studies I followed the course interaction technology in which I together with one teammate had to make a "smart" air freshner. We did this by using a arduino uno linked to an airwick machine and placing sensors arround it at the toilet in which it was placed. For this we had to develop code in C++ and we used the adruino IDE. This course included knowledge about both hardware and software. 

In order to get this code to open. Please use the arduino IDE.
